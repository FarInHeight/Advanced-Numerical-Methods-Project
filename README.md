# Advanced-Numerical-Methods-Project
This project is based on an implementation of SVD decomposition through the QR method. It is enriched by shifting, Hessemberg reduction, and Givens rotation matrices.

A complete overview of the project, with mathematics used, is available in [presentation.pdf](docs/presentation.pdf).
