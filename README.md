# Advanced-Numerical-Methods-Project
This project is based on the implementation of SVD decomposition through the QR method. It is enhanced by shifting, Hessemberg reduction and Givens rotation matrices.

A complete overview of the project, with mathematics used, is available in [presentation.pdf](docs/presentation.pdf).
